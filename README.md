# Di치rio Oficial

**Di치rio Oficial** is the Brazilian government gazette, one of the best places to know the latest actions of the public administration, with distinct publications in the federal, state and municipal levels.

Even with recurrent efforts of enforcing the [Freedom of Information legislation](http://www.acessoainformacao.gov.br/assuntos/conheca-seu-direito/principais-aspectos/principais-aspectos) across the country, official communication remains - in most of the territories - in PDFs.

The goal of this same project is to upgrade **Di치rio Oficial** to the year when it gets published, making accessible information that is currently only available.


## Build and Run

If you want to understand how Di치rio Oficial works, you'll want to get the source, build it, and run it locally.

The only prerequisites are [Docker](https://www.docker.com) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/overview/), which are the tools responsible for installing all the other dependencies.

After you cloned the repository, you may want to run the following from the source folder:

```console
$ make setup
$ docker-compose up
```

Once the download and building processes are finished, the processing tasks should start running in background, and the web server should be available at http://localhost:8080/.
