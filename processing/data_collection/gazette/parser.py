"""Pipeline to handle URL containing query parameters.

This pipeline is a temporary parser to remove existing query parameters in a URL string.
Example:
- The URL to download a gazette from Rio de Janeiro is http://doweb.rio.rj.gov.br/ler_pdf.php?download=ok&edi_id=3651
- Scrapy uses URL's sha1 to store the file locally
- However, Scrapy also uses the query parameter as file extension
Resulting filename: '4f15e18052b51dd8dffad1cc243279f40a2e21c3.php?download=ok&edi_id=3651'
- GazetteFilesPipeline ignores everything after file extension ('?download=ok&edi_id=3651')
and resulting in the following filename: '4f15e18052b51dd8dffad1cc243279f40a2e21c3.php'

This pipeline is temporary and could be deleted as soon as https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/pull/2809 gets merged

For more details, see https://github.com/okfn-brasil/diario-oficial/issues/15
